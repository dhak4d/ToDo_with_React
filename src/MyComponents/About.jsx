      <p >Todo Lists are the lists that we generally use to maintain our day-to-day tasks or list of everything 
      that we have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks
       at the bottom. It is helpful in planning our daily schedules. 
       We can add more tasks at any time and delete a task that is completed.</p>
       <p>The four major tasks that we can perform in a TODO list are:</p>
       
        <ol>
          <li>Add tasks</li>
         
          <li>Read tasks</li>
          <li>Delete tasks</li>
        </ol>

      <p>One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you stay organised.
         When you write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable. When you’ve got a clear outline of
          the tasks you’ve got to do and those you’ve completed, it helps you stay focused. 
          While freeing up space in your mind for other more creative tasks.</p>

          <p>When you complete a task, you can cross it off your list. This gives you a sense of progress 
            and achievement, something you’ll lack if you’re always rushing from one task to the next. 
            If you feel a sense of achievement, it spurs you on and motivates you to keep moving forward.</p>
            
            <p>But that’s not the only benefit of a to do list. Here are a few more:</p>

            <ul>
          <li>Improves your memory</li>
          <li>increases productivity</li>
          <li>Helps with motivation</li>
        </ul>
       
    </div>
